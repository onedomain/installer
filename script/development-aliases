# Some useful aliases when working on the vagrant box.
#
# You can revert to using the built-in commands by escaping these aliases, e.g. to run
# /usr/bin/flynn-host, use "\flynn-host" which will not use the alias.
#
# You may find it useful to add "source /vagrant/script/development-aliases" to ~/.bashrc

alias flynn="/vagrant/cli/bin/flynn"
alias flynn-host="/vagrant/host/bin/flynn-host"
alias flynn-release="/vagrant/util/release/flynn-release"
